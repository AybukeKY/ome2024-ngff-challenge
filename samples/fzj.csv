Each image is provided both in its original histological space, as well as aligned to the corresponding coronal section of the 3D-reconstructed BigBrain space. The images were acquired by rescanning the original histological sections of the BigBrain model at an in-plane resolution of 1µm. The sections were aligned to their corresponding coronal planes in the 20µm 3D-reconstructed BigBrain space using 2D non-linear transformations, and allow to identify microscopic features at the cellular level due to their increased resolution.",NCBI:txid9606,obo:FBbi_00000243
