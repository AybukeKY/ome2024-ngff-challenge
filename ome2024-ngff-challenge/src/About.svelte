  <h2>Introduction</h2>
  <p>
    The <a href="https://forum.image.sc/t/ome2024-ngff-challenge/97363">2024 OME-NGFF Challenge</a>
    was conceived at the
    <a href="https://www.openmicroscopy.org/events/ome-community-meeting-2024/">
      OME Annual Community Meeting</a>
    in Dundee in May 2024. The stated goals of Challenge were:
  </p>

  <ul>
    <li>
      Collect examples of OME-Zarr from multiple modalities, use cases, and
      institutions, available from a single location.
    </li>
    <li>
      Test the utility (and lack thereof) of existing OME-Zarr metadata and
      image viewers.
    </li>
    <li>
      Advance the adoption of the Zarr V3 specification, and also existing
      OME-Zarr RFCs.
    </li>
  </ul>
  <p>
    The inspiration for the Challenge came from presentations at the OME Meeting
    that demonstrated the level of adoption of OME-Zarr, but highlighted the
    poor findability of the data.
  </p>
  <p>
    Work on the challenge started in earnest in July 2024. All progress is
    tracked in the <a href="https://github.com/ome/ome2024-ngff-challenge">ome2024-ngff-challenge</a>
    repo. It was agreed that the results
    of the OME-NGFF Challenge would be presented at the
    <a href="https://globalbioimaging.org/exchange-of-experience/exchange-of-experience-ix">
      2024 Global BioImaging Meeting</a>.
  </p>

  <h2>Process</h2>
  <p>
    The Challenge was run via a series of virtual meetings coordinated on the
    Image.sc Forums, with all
    <a href="https://hackmd.io/3emKqKQsT_2U35vLepzDEQ">notes and lists of participants</a>
    available.
  </p>

  <h2>Results</h2>
  <p>
    At the outset, we werenâ€™t sure how much OME-Zarr data was available, if it
    could be converted to Zarr V3, or how many organisations would participate.
    In the end, we have far exceeded our expectations, with more than 0.5 PByte
    of OME-Zarr made available, across a wide range of modalities.
  </p>
  <p>
    To make the assembly as accessible as possible, we built the the OME-NGFF
    Challenge Viewer [URL?}, which incorporates a CSV with locations of
    datasets, and connects datasets to the OME NGFF Validator, for metadata
    validation and viewing.
  </p>
  <p>
    Perhaps the most important outcome of the Challenge is the establishment of
    a federated bioimage data system based on OME-Zarr. To our knowledge, this
    is the largest federated bioimage data collection ever assembled.
